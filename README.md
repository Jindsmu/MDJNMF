# MDJNMF
Multi-Dimensional Constrained Joint Non-Negative Matrix Factorization

This project builds an integrative multiple genomic imaging framework called multi-dimensional constrained joint non-negative matrix factorization (MDJNMF) to identify modules related to lung metastasis of sarcomas based on the sample-matched whole-solid image (WSI), DNA methylation, and copy number variation (CNV) features. 

The code in this project will reproduce the results in our paper, "Integrating Multiple Genomic Imaging Data for the
study of Lung Metastasis in Sarcomas using Multi-Dimensional Constrained Joint Non-Negative Matrix Factorization". Our codes were implemented and tested using win7, matlab/2016a.

You can run it by main.mat.  Note: The input data is in brance-master, and the code is in brance-code. You should download two brances from this page.
